# Automated-Data-Cleaning-with-Stored-Procedures
This project automates data cleaning for vaccination records in SQL Server. Stored procedures remove empty rows, drop irrelevant columns, rename fields, and standardize data types. The process transforms raw Excel imports into clean, analysis-ready datasets, enhancing efficiency and data accuracy in healthcare reporting.
